# Data Visualization Projects  
by Nina Mizrahi  

## Overview  
This repository houses a curated collection of data-visualization projects that showcase how I turn raw data into insightful stories, visual analytics, and interactive plots. With a foundation in computational neuroscience and machine learning, I bring both domain depth and technical fluency in Python, data processing libraries, and visualization tools.

### What’s inside  
- Jupyter Notebook and Python scripts where I process, clean, and visualise datasets.  
- Use of libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and possibly interactive libraries like `plotly` or `altair` (adjust if needed).  
- Visual outputs that are ready for communication: charts, heatmaps, time-series visualisations, dashboards.  
- Documentation of workflow: data ingestion → cleaning → transformation → exploration → visualisation → interpretation.

## Highlighted Skills  
- **Data Wrangling & Pre-processing** – cleaning messy data, handling missing values, converting types, normalising datasets for visualisation.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Insights Discovery** – using visual methods to reveal trends, outliers, distributions, relationships.  
- **Visualisation Design & Storytelling** – choosing appropriate chart types, applying colour / annotation / layout for clarity and impact.  
- **Reproducible Workflow & Tools** – notebooks are structured and documented; code is version-controlled; visualisations are embedded so others can inspect & expand.  
- **Interdisciplinary Context** – bridging neuroscience / machine learning grounding with data-visualisation practice makes for stronger insight framing.
